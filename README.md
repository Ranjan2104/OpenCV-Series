# OpenCV Series
 OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection. In this tutorial, we explain how you can use OpenCV in your applications.OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. ... OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays.
